### Virus
A virus is a type of malware that when executed it will self repilicates by modifying other computer programs 
and inserting their own code. When this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be infected. There are many types of computer viruses like Boot sector virus, Direct Action Virus, Web Scripting Virus etc



### Worm
A computer worm is a self-replicating malware program whose primary purpose is to infect other computers by duplicating itself while remaining active on infected systems. Wannacry is a famous example of a ransomware cryptoworm.

### Trojan Horse
A trojan horse or trojan is any malware that misleads users of its true intent by pretending to be a legitimate program. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.

### Rootkits
A rootkit is a collection of malware designed to give unauthorized access to a computer or area of its software and often masks its existence or the existence of other software.  

Rootkit installation can be automated or the attacker can install it with administrator access.

### Ransomware
Ransomware is a form of malware, designed to deny access to a computer system or data until ransom is paid. Ransomware spreads through phishing emails, malvertising, visiting infected websites or by exploiting vulnerabilities

### Keylogger 
Keyloggers keystroke loggers or system monitoring are a type of malware used to monitor and record each keystroke typed on a specific computer's keyboard. Keyloggers are also available for smartphones.

Keyloggers store gathered information and send it to the attacker who can then extract sensitive information like login credentials and credit card details.

### Adware
Adware is a type of malware designed to put advertisements on your screen, often in a web browser or popup.  

Typically it distinguishes itself as legitimate or piggybacks on another program to trick you into installing it on your computer, tablet or smartphone.

Adware is one of the most profitable, least harmful forms of malware and is becoming increasingly popular on mobile devices. Adware generates revenue by automatically displaying advertisement to the user of the software.

### Spyware

Spyware is malware that gathers information about a person or organization, sometimes without their knowledge, and sends the information to the attacker without the victim's consent.

Some types of spyware can install additional software and change the settings on your device. Spyware is usually simple to remove because it is not as nefarious as other types of malware.

### Bots and Botnets
A bot is a computer that is infected with malware that allows it to be remotely controlled by an attacker. 

The bot (or zombie computer) can then be used to launch more cyber attacks or become part of a botnet (a collection of bots).

Botnets are a popular method for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, spreading ransomware, keylogging and spreading other types of malware.

### Backdoor
A backdoor is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. router) or other part of a computer. 

Backdoors are commonly used to secure remote access to a computer or gain access to encrypted files.

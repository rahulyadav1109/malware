# Description
  Snake Keylogger is a malware developed using .NET. It first appeared in late 2020 and focused on stealing sensitive information from a victim’s device,     including saved credentials, the victim’s keystrokes, screenshots of the victim’s screen, and clipboard data. 
  
  In July, 2021, Snake Keylogger first entered into a TOP 10 popular malware families report, meaning that the Snake Keylogger family is increasing its       influence and impacting more people’s devices and sensitive data.
  
  Today(04/05/2022) I have found latest variant of Snake Keylogger from Malware Bazaar(https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/). 
  
  
# What is Snake Keylogger
  Snake Keylogger is a modular .NET keylogger and credential stealer. Its primary function is to record users’ keystrokes on computers or mobile devices,     and transmit the collected data to threat actors.
  
  The worst thing about keylogger attacks is that many people tend to use the same password and username for different accounts, and once one is breached,    the cybercriminal gains access to all those that have the same password. To stop them, it is essential to use a unique option for each of the different    profiles. To do this, a password manager can be used, which allows both managing and generating different robust access combinations for each service      based on the guidelines decided upon.

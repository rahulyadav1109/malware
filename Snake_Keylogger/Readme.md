# Description
  Snake Keylogger is a malware developed using .NET. It first appeared in late 2020 and focused on stealing sensitive information from a victim’s device,     including saved credentials, the victim’s keystrokes, screenshots of the victim’s screen, and clipboard data. 
  
  In July, 2021, Snake Keylogger first entered into a TOP 10 popular malware families report, meaning that the Snake Keylogger family is increasing its       influence and impacting more people’s devices and sensitive data.
  
  Today(04/05/2022) I have found latest variant of Snake Keylogger from Malware Bazaar(https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/).

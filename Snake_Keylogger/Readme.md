# Description
  Snake Keylogger is a malware developed using .NET. It first appeared in late 2020 and focused on stealing sensitive information from a victim’s device,     including saved credentials, the victim’s keystrokes, screenshots of the victim’s screen, and clipboard data. 
  
  In July, 2021, Snake Keylogger first entered into a TOP 10 popular malware families report, meaning that the Snake Keylogger family is increasing its       influence and impacting more people’s devices and sensitive data.

# What is Snake Keylogger
  Snake Keylogger is a modular .NET keylogger and credential stealer. Its primary function is to record users’ keystrokes on computers or mobile devices,     and transmit the collected data to threat actors.
  Snake malware's main feature is keylogging (records key strokes), however, this program has other functionality as well. It can take screenshots and       extract data stored in the clipboard (i.e. copy/paste buffer).

# Details about Snake Keylogger
  Snake is a malicious program classified as a keylogger. As the classification implies, the primary function of this malware is keylogging. Therefore,       Snake infections pose a threat to the privacy/safety of all typed information.
  
  The worst thing about keylogger attacks is that many people tend to use the same password and username for different accounts, and once one is breached,    the cybercriminal gains access to all those that have the same password. To stop them, it is essential to use a unique option for each of the different    profiles. To do this, a password manager can be used, which allows both managing and generating different robust access combinations for each service      based on the guidelines decided upon.
  
# Finding the malware is packed or obfuscated or not
  I used Exeinfo to find out the file is packed or not but i didnt get the desired result, So i used peview tool to find the difference between the IMAGE     SECTION HEADER RAW SIZE and VIRTUAL SIZE (If the difference between the raw size and virtual size is large the its is an indicator the the file is         packed) but the difference between both the sizes was minimal so using this info i get to know the the file is not packed.
